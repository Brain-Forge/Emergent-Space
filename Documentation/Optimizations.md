OPTIMIZATIONS

Overview

This document details strategies to optimize the physics and lighting engine for performance while maintaining high fidelity in simulation. The goal is to ensure that the system scales well with many agents and supports real-time multiplayer.

Key Optimization Strategies
	1.	Multi-Threading and Concurrency:
	•	Partition physics and lighting calculations across multiple threads.
	•	Use Rust’s ownership model to safely share immutable data.
	•	Implement job queues and double-buffering to manage thread synchronization.
	2.	Spatial Partitioning and Caching:
	•	Utilize quad-trees or Barnes-Hut algorithms to reduce the O(n²) complexity of interactions.
	•	Cache intermediate state results for distant objects and update less frequently.
	•	Use delta compression for state snapshots to reduce memory usage.
	3.	Adaptive Time Stepping:
	•	Dynamically adjust the simulation time step based on the activity level in a region.
	•	Use smaller steps during high-interaction events and larger steps when objects are far apart.
	4.	Precomputation and Lookup Tables:
	•	Precompute frequently used values (e.g., Taylor series approximations) for low-speed regimes.
	•	Use lookup tables for light propagation and shading in static regions.
	5.	Memory Management:
	•	Optimize data structures for cache locality.
	•	Employ custom allocators if necessary to handle the high throughput of state updates.

Implementation Steps
	1.	Profile Baseline Performance:
	•	Identify bottlenecks in physics calculations, light rendering, and network synchronization.
	2.	Iterative Optimization:
	•	Apply optimizations incrementally and measure improvements.
	•	Document each optimization’s impact and fallback strategies in case of regressions.
	3.	Robust Testing:
	•	Use stress tests and long-run simulations to ensure that optimizations do not affect determinism or numerical stability.
