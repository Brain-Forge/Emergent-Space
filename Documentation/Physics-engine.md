PHYSICS ENGINE

Overview

The physics engine will simulate both Newtonian and relativistic dynamics. It uses adaptive precision based on thresholds, spatial partitioning for distant objects, and a multi-threaded architecture for computational efficiency.

Core Equations and Principles
	1.	Newtonian Mechanics:
	•	Force and Acceleration: F = m · a
	•	Gravitational Force: F = G · (m₁ · m₂) / r²
	•	Kinetic Energy and Momentum: KE = ½ · m · v², p = m · v
	2.	Relativistic Mechanics:
	•	Lorentz Factor: γ = 1 / √(1 − (v²/c²))
	•	Relativistic Momentum and Energy: p = γ · m · v, E = γ · m · c²
	•	Force (Parallel Acceleration): F = m · γ³ · dv/dt
	3.	Adaptive Precision & Taylor Expansion:
	•	Low-Speed Regime (v/c < 0.1): Use Newtonian formulas or truncated expansion: γ ≈ 1 + ½(v²/c²)
	•	Intermediate Regime (0.1 < v/c < 0.5): Include higher-order terms (e.g., γ ≈ 1 + ½(v²/c²) + 3/8(v⁴/c⁴))
	•	High-Speed Regime (v/c > 0.5): Switch to full relativistic equations.

Implementation Steps
	1.	Define Thresholds:
	•	Establish clear numerical thresholds (e.g., v/c values) for switching between approximation regimes.
	•	Document these thresholds with expected error margins and performance impacts.
	2.	Spatial Partitioning:
	•	Implement a quad-tree or Barnes-Hut structure to group distant objects.
	•	Precompute aggregated mass and center-of-mass for each node to approximate gravitational effects.
	3.	Time-Step and Integration:
	•	Use symplectic integrators (e.g., Verlet or leapfrog) for Newtonian dynamics.
	•	Employ adaptive time stepping for high-speed interactions.
	•	Evaluate when to switch to higher-order integrators (like RK4) for relativistic corrections.
	4.	Multi-threading:
	•	Divide physics computations among multiple threads.
	•	Ensure proper synchronization (e.g., double buffering or a job queue system) to prevent race conditions.
	5.	State Caching and Precomputation:
	•	Cache computed states (positions, velocities) for distant objects.
	•	Implement delta-compression for state snapshots to manage memory usage efficiently.
	•	Schedule periodic recalculations for regions transitioning from low to high interest.

Testing and Validation
	•	Unit Tests: Validate individual equations and integration routines.
	•	Simulation Consistency: Run long-term simulations to check for energy conservation and numerical stability.
	•	Benchmarking: Profile the performance of spatial partitioning and multi-threading to ensure scaling.
