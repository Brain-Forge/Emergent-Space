LIGHTING

Overview

The lighting module simulates realistic light propagation in the 2D space environment. It leverages simplified models and adaptive techniques to balance realism with performance.

Core Concepts
	1.	Point Source Approximation:
	•	Treat objects such as ships and suns as single-point emitters.
	•	For a ship, use the center point as the light source; for a sun, a singular or few representative points.
	2.	Ray Casting and Deferred Lighting:
	•	Use ray casting from these key points to simulate effects like shadows and reflections.
	•	Consider a deferred lighting approach where lighting is applied as a post-processing effect after geometry is rendered.
	3.	Relativistic Light Effects:
	•	Aberration: Adjust light direction based on observer velocity using:
cos(θ′) = (cos(θ) + v/c) / (1 + (v/c) · cos(θ))
	•	Doppler Shift: Simulate frequency shifts with:
f′ = f · √((1 + v/c) / (1 − v/c))
	•	Gravitational Lensing: Approximate deflection using:
δθ ≈ 4GM/(rc²)

Implementation Steps
	1.	Determine Light Sources:
	•	Catalog all objects that emit light.
	•	For non-emissive objects, consider only how they interact with light (reflection, occlusion).
	2.	Simplify Light Emission:
	•	Use a central point for each emissive object to launch rays.
	•	Define quality settings that can scale the number of rays based on performance requirements.
	3.	Adaptive Sampling:
	•	In regions of high visual interest, increase the number of rays and precision.
	•	For distant objects, rely on precomputed light maps or lower-fidelity approximations.
	4.	Relativistic Adjustments:
	•	Incorporate aberration and Doppler calculations only in zones where speeds are significant relative to c.
	•	Provide an interpolation mechanism between static and dynamic light behavior as objects transition across thresholds.
	5.	Integration with Rendering:
	•	Coordinate with the rendering module to overlay lighting effects without recalculating for every frame.
	•	Use shaders for real-time adjustments based on precomputed light data.
