MULTIPLAYER NETWORKING

Overview

This document outlines strategies for ensuring that the physics simulation and lighting effects remain deterministic and synchronized in a multiplayer environment.

Key Considerations
	1.	Determinism:
	•	Ensure that all physics calculations yield identical results across different machines.
	•	Consider using fixed time steps and deterministic algorithms (or fixed-point arithmetic for critical sections).
	2.	State Synchronization:
	•	Implement a server-authoritative model to maintain a single source of truth.
	•	Periodically transmit state snapshots and use delta compression to minimize bandwidth.
	3.	Client-Side Prediction and Reconciliation:
	•	Allow clients to predict movement and light effects based on previous state data.
	•	Use server reconciliation to correct any discrepancies, ensuring smooth visual transitions.
	4.	Latency and Jitter Compensation:
	•	Design the networking layer to handle variable latency.
	•	Employ buffering and interpolation strategies to ensure smooth updates for dynamic light and physics.

Implementation Steps
	1.	Define the Data Model:
	•	Establish a consistent data schema for object states (positions, velocities, light parameters).
	•	Use a binary format or protocol that minimizes serialization overhead.
	2.	Synchronize Update Loops:
	•	Align the physics and lighting update loops with network update intervals.
	•	Ensure that all clients use the same fixed time steps for simulation.
	3.	Implement Prediction Mechanisms:
	•	Develop a client-side prediction system that extrapolates state between server updates.
	•	Integrate rollback or correction mechanisms to reconcile differences.
	4.	Testing Under Network Conditions:
	•	Simulate high-latency and packet loss environments to validate synchronization.
	•	Profile the performance impact of state transmission and prediction corrections.
